<span class="image main">![](assets/images/about/Team2.png)</span>

Team2Fast is comprised of five MIT undergraduates across the AeroAstro Department and Computer Science and Engineering Department along with one teammate who is no longer a student but is taking the class because he can. Although the teammates have different strengths, everyone is interested in gaining more software development experience. Their more specific focuses range from algorithm efficiency, controls, and autonomy, among other things. Overall, the team's experiences and passions will help them be successful throughout the class.
